**Rooms**

The Royal Chambers

A secluded room of the king and queen where long days of stress and gluttony are slept away within these chambers. A king size canopy bed can be found with an adorned dresser full of clean white linens, and a stunning view of the river Rhemes that separates land governed by Folksreach and the neighboring nation of Goering.

The Throne Room

A spacious yet purposeful hallway with a craftsmen wooden throne stationed opposite to large wooden doors. Sunlight pierces through small glass windows near the ceiling of the room, casting a golden hue onto the worn royal carpet that has lasted many generations.

The Sanctuary

A small sanctuary resides in the royal hall. Short benches fill the room facing an adorned catholic tribute where royals and servants give charity to local ministers.

The Gatehouse

The main gate or port of entry into Folksreach. Guards are stationed along the city walls throughout day and night, and are fed by the state well although irregularly.

The Gallows / Public

Where royal decrees and public executions of criminals are held. A balcony of the royal hall overlooks a wooden gallows stage where the common folk gather to hear the local news and state of affairs.

The Dining Hall

A dimly-lit mead hall of Anglo-saxon architecture. Royal advisors and neighboring leaders gather here to discuss alliances over poultry and potatoes; devising trade routes and armed escorts for legal tender, and ensuring political ties for generations.

**Characters**

The King *(non-playable)*

The lord of Falksreach. An honest king who rules over the subjects of Falksreach, and after the first events of the story becomes disoriented and disheveled, uncertain of who remains loyal in impeding wartime relations with neighboring nation *Goering*.

Two resources are earned and spent by the player. The reputation score is the sum of the individual reputations of the queen, the prince, and the priest. Additionally, the health of the king is tracked through a meter of: healthy, ill, wounded, dying; and will affect the actions the player may choose throughout the story.

The Queen

The commonfolk’s royal darling. A young aspirational woman that hears the needs of the people, and has the fortune and privilege of wealth and other nobility to see her subjects treated well. Discovering the neighboring nation *Goering's* plot to siege the city, she means to stage a “charity mission” where the royal family would secretly relocate to safety, away from the ill-equipped city of Folksreach, in the nation's capital without the people's knowledge.

*One of three endings the player must choose. The player must have a positive reputation with the king, the prince, and the priest.*

The Prince

The royal heir to the throne. A misguided preteen, the child wanders the royal hall in-between writing practice or dull conversation with the emotionally distant noble children.

*Assuming the player reaches the ending with more than 10 reputation and the king retains the healthy status, the prince successfully inherits the throne and peace prospers. One of three endings the player may choose.*

The Priest

The priest to the royal family. After sudden illness took the kings mother, he pledges to lead the “astrayed” king along the holy path to enlightenment. However, the king must devote his life to celibacy in order to redeem his bloodline.

*One of three endings the player may choose. To pursue this ending the player must have a positive reputation with the king and negative reputation with the queen.*
