Reflection: 

Our visual novel game was made using concepts incorporated from the course. While creating the game, we focused on giving the player choices that matter, using visuals and sound to build mood, and thinking about how games can show deeper messages. We included several key ideas from the lectures: agency, aesthetics, and habitus.

One major idea we used is agency from Week 7\. The definition of Agency means giving players control over what happens in the game. In our story, the player can choose how the King reacts to war, who to trust, and what actions to take. These choices change how other characters see the player, and they also lead to different endings. This shows both narrative agency (changing the story) and mechanical agency (changing the game system).

From Week 6, we used the idea of habitus. This means that a person’s background and past of gaming experiences affect how they play. Our characters, like the Queen, Priest, and Prince, each represent different values and endings in the game. Depending on the player’s own choices and taste, they may choose different paths. For example, someone might trust the Queen’s plan to help the people, while another might follow the Priest’s religious advice. These choices reflect the player’s own thinking and culture.

We also paid attention to our choices of aesthetics, of how the game looks, sounds, and feels. Specifically to our designs of different rooms with unique designs, and sticking with how a stereotypical look of the medieval character appearances. We design each scene to support the story, with the according characters and narrative flow. In addition, keeping our character art and backgrounds are consistent with this setting to help the story feel more immersive.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was learning how to code the game in Ren'Py. None of us had much experience with it at first, so we had to learn everything from scratch. These obstacles include learning how to add choices, track reputation points, and trigger different endings. 

Process Documentation: 

1. We discussed as a group to plan the overall design of the game  
2. Roles were distributed   
3. Each individual work on their assigned parts  
4. Group meetings to ensure everyone’s work can be put together  
5. Game is created and designed through Ren'Py. 

Role Distribution: Each of us took on a part in creating the game—whether it was finding assets like images, backgrounds, and scenes, learning how to code and build the game’s mechanics, or documenting the development process and writing the reflection.
